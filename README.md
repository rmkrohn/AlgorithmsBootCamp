# AlgorithmsBootCamp

In March of 2016, I gave a series of algorithms lectures at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to prepare for the 2016 ACM ICPC World Finals. Each lecture was accompanied by code examples and competitive programming problems utilizing the algorithm in the solution. These lectures were recorded, and are now available online as training materials for other ICPC competitors.

The syllabus outlines the topics covered, including links to lecture videos. A selection of practice problems for each topic is also provided; these problems come from a variety of online judging systems. Lecture example code, when indicated, is available in the corresponding topic directory.

These materials are intended to fill specific knowledge gaps for students already familiar with competitive programming, and not as an introduction. Topics were selected with a junior-level computer science student in mind; background in data structures and algorithms is strongly recommended. Some lectures build upon previous topics, so videos should be viewed in order when possible.
